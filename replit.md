# Receita Federal Payment Portal

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that simulates a Brazilian Federal Revenue Service (Receita Federal) portal for tax payment regularization. The application handles customer data retrieval, generates payment requests via PIX (Brazilian instant payment system), and integrates with the For4Payments API for payment processing.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions with environment-based secret key
- **Logging**: Python's built-in logging module configured for debug level
- **HTTP Client**: Requests library for external API communication

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 (Flask's default)
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS (CDN)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 5.15.3
- **Custom Fonts**: Rawline font family with multiple weights
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for countdown timers and form interactions

### API Integration
- **Customer Data API**: External lead database at `api-lista-leads.replit.app`
- **Payment Processing**: For4Payments API integration for PIX payments

## Key Components

### 1. Main Application (`app.py`)
- Flask application setup with session management
- Customer data retrieval from external API
- UTM parameter handling for SMS campaigns
- Route handling for different pages

### 2. Payment Integration (`for4payments.py`)
- For4Payments API wrapper class
- PIX payment creation functionality
- Error handling and validation for payment data
- Authentication token management

### 3. Templates
- **index.html**: Main landing page with customer information display
- **buscar-cpf.html**: CPF search functionality
- **verificar-cpf.html**: CPF verification page

### 4. Static Assets
- **countdown.js**: JavaScript countdown timer functionality
- **fonts/**: Custom Rawline font files in WOFF2 format

## Data Flow

1. **Customer Identification**: 
   - UTM parameters capture customer phone number
   - External API lookup retrieves customer data (name, CPF)
   - Session storage maintains customer information

2. **Payment Processing**:
   - Customer data validation (CPF format, email generation)
   - Payment request creation via For4Payments API
   - PIX payment generation with QR code and payment link

3. **User Interface**:
   - Dynamic content rendering based on customer data
   - Countdown timer for payment urgency
   - Responsive design for mobile compatibility
